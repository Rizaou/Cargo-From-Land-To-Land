* To play the game, you need to enable device smulator or connect your phone to Unity. I used Input.Touch() instead of Input.GetMouse() function.
* Me and my friend crated this game. All the assets belong to us.

# How To Play

* The main mechanic is holding your finger on the screen and changing the position of the player (in the car or above the car).
* If the player is above the car, you can throw the cargo packages toward the houses which have white doors by touching the door of the house.
* You can't move the car if the player above the car.
